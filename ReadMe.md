This project is for GUI testing of the webpage Fortea.
The tests are Java - Selenium - TestNG - with a Maven builder.
The tests are using the UI Page Model for Architecture and Design.
The tests are configured to run on the production page as Pre-prod was not available during the building of the repo.
